In this repository you can find a cute memory game made only with a short HTML file, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to play üß†

Like any other memory game you need to match two identical cards. Whenever you matched all the cards, you win/finished the game.  
I added a Timer in case you want to play against the time! ‚è≥ So all you need to do is press the button "Start Timer" and you'll have 30s to match the cards! :)
